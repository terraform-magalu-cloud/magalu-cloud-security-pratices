### How Help with Security

This defines the project's security policy, focusing on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

**Technical Analysis:**
*   **Responsible Disclosure**: The primary guideline is to **NOT** open a public issue for vulnerabilities. This prevents malicious actors from exploiting the flaw before it's patched.
*   **Private Channel**: It provides a private communication channel (an email address) for reporting, which is the industry-standard practice.
*
